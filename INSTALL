Hello.

Thank you for trying to install Luminous Flux.

Here's what you'll have to do:

* install dependencies given in requirements.txt
  we recommend using pbundler for this: https://github.com/zeha/pbundler
  but `pip install -r requirements.txt` should work too
* install database connector as listed at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/install/#database-installation
* create a local_settings.py (using local_settings.py.template as a template) OR set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to something that's not local_settings (like localsettings)
* run the following commands (prepend with "pbundler run" if using pbundler)
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py collectstatic --noinput
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py syncdb
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py migrate lstory 0008
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py migrate tumblelog
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py migrate lstory
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py migrate
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py compilemessages

Then, create a site via the command line `./lfluxproject/manage.py shell`:

>>> from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
>>> Site.objects.create(name='example.com', domain='example.com')

Have fun!
