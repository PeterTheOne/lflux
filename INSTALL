Hello.

Thank you for trying to install Luminous Flux.

Here's what you'll have to do:

* install dependencies. they are given in requirements.txt; we recommend using pbundler for this: https://github.com/zeha/pbundler
* add database settings in settings.py
* add a SECRET_KEY in settings.py - you'll get a TypeError otherwise

Have fun!
