Hello.

Thank you for trying to install Luminous Flux.

Here's what you'll have to do:

* install dependencies given in requirements.txt
  we recommend using pbundler for this: https://github.com/zeha/pbundler
  but `pip install -r requirements.txt` should work too
* install database connector as listed at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/install/#database-installation
* in settings.py
 - edit database settings
 - change the SECRET_KEY to a unique long string
 - change the EMAIL_BACKEND to something more sensible
* run the following commands
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py collectstatic --noinput
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py syncdb
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py migrate
> ./lfluxproject/manage.py compilemessages

Have fun!
